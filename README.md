## Description

This is a browser-based Hangman game where players try to guess a randomly chosen word by selecting letters. The game includes categories like programming languages, movies, famous people, and countries.

If the player guesses incorrectly 8 times, the game is over. If the player correctly guesses all letters, they win, and a fireworks animation is displayed.

## Features

- Randomly generated words from four categories: Programming, Movies, People, and Countries.
- Feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
- Sound effects for winning, losing, and correct guesses.
- Fireworks animation for a successful game completion.
- Option to restart the game after winning or losing.

## How to Play

1. Select letters by clicking on them.
2. If the letter is in the word, it will appear in the correct position.
3. If the letter is not in the word, you will get closer to being "hanged."
4. The game ends after 8 incorrect guesses or if you guess the word correctly.
